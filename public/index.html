    <p>Monster of the Week is a roleplaying game created by and made by based on the Apocolypse World rules.
    Players take on the roles of Hunters joined together in a party each with their own backstory for being there.
    The Keeper, (Dungeonmaster) controls the ebb and flow of the story you all make together.  I mean, basically its a
    very story driven roleplaying game.</p>
